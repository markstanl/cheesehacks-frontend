There should be two distinct sections of the front end of this application:
Login
- the application should use only google SSO and tag users anonymously so we can keep their 
authentication
- use nextAuth and tailwind to set up google SSO

Quiz:
- The quiz will be a call and response between the frontend (us) and the backend, the backend will use API routes that specify the information, you may use placeholders for now
- The request to the API should specify the theme of the question (preset hardcoded list)
- The Backend will send an api response with the question and the responses (mimic this for now)
- the frontend will locally store the questions and answers and send a final submit of all the questions and answers they had
- JSON Question send:
	{
		"id": 294029492059020
		"question_type": 0-6 (different question types e.g. single select, multi-select, etc.)
		"question": {"number": 1, "text": "What is the middle of the world?"}
		"answers": [
		    {"id": 0, "text": "foo"},
		    {"id": 2, "text": "bar"},
		    {"id": 1, "text": "baz"}
		]
	}
Diagnostics:
- The diagnostics will send an API call to query the backend for information on the user that is logged in
- these diagnostics will be displayed, mock this for now

Styling:
-Style this in a human way, attempt to make the website incorporate the color scheme and feelings of the UW madison website
